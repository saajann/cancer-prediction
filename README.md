## Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of breast cancer based on various medical features. The model is trained on a dataset of patient records and uses features such as age, tumor size, and other relevant medical information. The web application allows users to input these features and visualize the predictions.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cancer-prediction.git
cd cancer-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the Streamlit web application, use the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This will start the web application, and you can interact with it through your web browser.
