## Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of cancer based on various medical features. The model is trained on a dataset of patient records and uses features such as age, tumor size, and other relevant medical information.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cancer-prediction.git
cd cancer-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To train the model, run the following command:
```bash
python train.py
```
To make predictions using the trained model, run:
```bash
python predict.py --input data/sample_input.csv
```
